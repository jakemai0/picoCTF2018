For this challenge we need to use a hex editor to see the content of a binary file.
On Mac or Linux we can just do it in Vim (still a beginner but loving it already, so powerful).
Open the file in Vim, go to hex edit mode by :%!xxd
flag is at the bottom of the file (type G)

OR

ignore all of the above and just use strings function:

strings hex_editor.jpg

flag:picoCTF{and_thats_how_u_edit_hex_kittos_dF817ec5}
