this is a forensics challenge, so an useful tool to have is 'foremost'
used to recover files from disk image. All we need to do is to run:

foremost animals.dd

There would be a new created folder called output, inside are the audit txt file
produced by foremost and another jpg folder, which contains all the jpgs files of
the animals, plus the flag that we need to find.

flag is: 
picoCTF{th3_5n4p_happ3n3d}
