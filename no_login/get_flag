We were given a site, there is no login but we need admin privilige to
be able to click and retrieve the flag. Hint is 'what is it actually
looking for in the cookie?' The admin cookie?

lets try to add the cookie in.
Using 'edit this cookie' extension on chrome, add cookie.
Name set as: admin
Value set as idk maybe: root

and voila we're in.

flag is picoCTF{n0l0g0n_n0_pr0bl3m_ed714e0e}
