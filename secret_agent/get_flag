Given a website that hasnt fully been finished. BUT the hints are:
-Google gets all your info anyway
-How can your browser pretend to be something else?

When we click on the button 'Flag' from the website, it said: 'You're not google! Mozilla/5.0 (X11;
Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.109 Safari/537.36'

From the hints above, I think we need to make the chrome browser to pretend to be the web crawler from
google, in order to get the info from the website.

How do we do that?
Lets google 'google user agent'

the first link shows us all the crawler used by google: Crawler; User agent tokens; Full user agent
string (as seen in website log files) (the full user agent string looks quite alike the text we received
from the webpage when we clicked on the Flag button).

Lets try with this agent Googglebot(Desktop): Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html) Safari/537.36

Use 'curl --user-agent' to set the user agent:

curl --user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Googleb    ot/2.1;
+http://www.google.com/bot.html) Safari/537.36" http://2018shell.picoctf.com:11421/flag

It will return the html file of the website including the flag, we just need to grep it out.

Basically an user agent is a software that is acting on behalf of the user, sending the webserver
information about the user Web Browser and OS (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE; Linux Ubuntu, Mac OS X,
Windows 10)
