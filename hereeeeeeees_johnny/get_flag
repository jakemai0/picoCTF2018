okay so this one is pretty tricky.
The Hereeeeeeeee's Johnny reference is about John the Ripper brute forcing software.
We were told to netcat to this server, however it requires an username, password combo that
we do not know about, 2 files were given: passwd and shadow.

Git cloned John the ripper from github, installed it,
./unshadow passwd shadow

the hashed password turned out to be 'hellokitty' and the username is root

netcat to the server with the port given:
nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 42165

username: root
password: hellokitty

and we got the flag: picoCTF{J0hn_1$_R1pp3d_5f9a67aa}

OR

we can make a script...
