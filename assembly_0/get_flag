asm0:
	push	ebp
	mov	ebp,esp
	mov	eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
	mov	ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]
	mov	eax,ebx
	mov	esp,ebp
	pop	ebp	
	ret


okay so we have the Source file here as above.

question is what does asm0(0xb6, 0xc6) return? Output should be a hexadecimal value.

Mann to be honest I've never touched on assembly language before, but let's try to
crack this with some help.

we know what we need to run asm0 function with 2 given arguments, 0xb6 and 0xc6.
here is the asm0 function:

asm0:
          push    ebp
          mov     ebp,esp
          mov     eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
          mov     ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]
          mov     eax,ebx
          mov     esp,ebp
          pop     ebp
          ret

push ebp
move ebp, esp
these two lines are function prologue, not that important to inspect

next two lines, we have:
mov     eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
mov     ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]

I kinda guess that eax = 0x8 and ebx = 0xc,
from asm0(0xb6, 0xc6) => eax = 0xb6, ebx = 0xc6

next line we have:
mov     eax,ebx => eax = ebx = 0xc6

next 2 lines are function epilogue
then we return the value.

flag: 0xc6

system engineer and forensics engineers are truly genious, how can I be like that?
