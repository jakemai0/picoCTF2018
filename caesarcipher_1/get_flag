the good old caesar cipher from first year of uni :)
now we have the encrypted flag, just gotta decrypt it, instead of just using a tool
online, we can use 'caesar' tool from the command line:

cat ciphertext| cut -d "{" -f2 | cut -d "}" -f1 | caesar 1

we coulda do this manually from 1 to 26, but lets use a for loop instead

for i in {1..26}; do cat ciphertext| cut -d "{" -f2 | cut -d "}" -f1 | caesar $i; done

flag is: picoCTF{justagoodoldcaesarcipherfwacbovv}
