Cryptography challenge,
We gotta decode this substitution cipher, ciphertext is a huge 
paragraph. 

So I went online to look for some substitution cipher decoder, and
quipqiup.com seems to give the best answer. 

flag: substitution_ciphers_are_solvable_fcpocdgwte
wrap this in proper flag format we have:
picoCTF{substitution_ciphers_are_solvable_fcpocdgwte}
