this one was pretty difficult for me to be honest.
So we needed a disassembler to break down the executable program. 

So once we see how the program is executed, it will call the getkey() function, thus triggered the alarm to say
that 'you need a faster machine, bye' and close the program. We dont want that.

We want it to run getkey(), and then printflag(), so we use the GNU Debugger: gdb

open the file using gdb,

then type 'break main' (idk maybe to create a break point, we want to run the program one fuction at a
time)

now we: call (char *) get_key(): it will then calculate the key
then:   call (char *) print_flag(): to print out the flag, and voila

flag is:

Reverse Engineering requires such deep computing and programming knowledge, dang!
