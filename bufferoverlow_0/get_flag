the famous bufferoverflow.
I will start learning about C next trimester, but I've been doing a bit of reading in my spare time,
let's do this.

We were given a binary "vuln" file and a source "vuln.c" file.
after inspecting the vuln.c file,
we know that we need to overflow 16 characters in the buffer.
Do this on pico server.1

Once we're in pico server, try to run vuln with 'hello' as argument, we would get 'Thanks! Received: hello'
Now let's try to give vuln this argument: imjustgonnatrytofeedyouacraptonofinputletsseeifyouwillbreak

It breaks and spits out the flag: 

picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_a54b012c}
